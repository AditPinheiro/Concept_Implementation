# Concept_Implementation
Implementing various concepts in Python and Machine Learning


This code was written to implement one of the simpler concepts in Machine Learning ie; Linear Regression.
The Student Performance dataset ("student-mav.csv") from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was explored and analyzed.
Using Linear Regression model we are able to predict what the final score for the student, given the attributes of the student.
The model achieved an average accuracy of 82.364 (average of 5 test runs).
